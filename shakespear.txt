William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April[b] 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[c] was an English playwright, 
poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and 
the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and 
the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").[5][d] His extant works, including collaborations, 
consist of some 39 plays,[e] 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, 
some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language 
and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7] He remains arguably the 
most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and 
reinterpreted.

Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he 
married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. 
Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, 
and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the 
King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died 
three years later.
